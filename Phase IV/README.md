# **AASTU Digital Library**

This is web library for aastu university students.
we think this site makes easy access of subject materials also assignments tests.
The project is worked in a team.
### The first page to open is index page.

we created and export a My SQL query and this query have a sample data to log in as user and as an admin. especialy for the admin there is no way to sign up so this sample data is impotant.

## The Exported final Database file name is 'aastu_library (2).sql' on root folder(phase IV)
# Sample Data

**adding profile picture**

**On report page - piechart is generated from an online source- therefore internet connection is needed for the piechart**

### Dependancies

**Bootstrap 4 (offline)
**Fontawesome (offline)
**Piechart (needs internet connection)
