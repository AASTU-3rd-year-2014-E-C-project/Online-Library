# **AASTU Digital Library**

This is web library for aastu university students.
we think this site makes easy access of subject materials also assignments tests.
The project is worked in a team.
### The first page to open is index page.

we created and export a My SQL query and this query have a sample data to log in as user and as an admin. especialy for the admin there is no way to sign up so this sample data is impotant.
Sample Data

# user Data                     Admin Data

username: ETS0505/12          username: NahomHabtamu@admin

password:123456789            password: 123456789

Admin have a special privilage on looking for report pages.
when the user sign in the the landing page will change to the book_list page so he/she can't get back to the login page unless he/she logs out.
the user session allow the user to get to profile page which allow to edit the data he/she entered while sign up.
