                        Rhōmaíōn) was the post-Republican period of ancient Rome. As a polity it included large territorial holdings around the<br>
                        Mediterranean Sea in Europe, Northern Africa, and Western Asia ruled by emperors. From the accession of Caesar Augustus<br>
                        to the military anarchy of the 3rd century, it was a principate with Italy as metropole of the provinces and the city of<br>
                        Rome as sole capital (27 BC – AD 286). After the military crisis, the empire was ruled by multiple emperors who shared<br>
                        rule over the Western Roman Empire and over the Eastern Roman Empire. Rome remained the nominal capital of both parts<br>
                        until AD 476, when the imperial insignia were sent to Constantinople[citation needed], following the capture of Ravenna<br>
                        by the barbarians of Odoacer and the subsequent deposition of Romulus Augustulus. </td>

                        became severely destabilized in a series of civil wars and political conflicts. In the mid-1st century BC, Julius Caesar<br>
                        was appointed as perpetual dictator and then assassinated in 44 BC. Civil wars and proscriptions continued, eventually<br>
                        culminating in the victory of Octavian, Caesar's adopted son, over Mark Antony and Cleopatra at the Battle of Actium in<br>
                        31 BC. The following year Octavian conquered Ptolemaic Egypt, ending the Hellenistic period that had begun with the<br>
                        conquests of Alexander the Great of Macedon in the 4th century BC. Octavian's power then became unassailable, and in 27<br>
                        BC the Roman Senate formally granted him overarching power and the new title Augustus, effectively making him the first<br>
                        Roman emperor.</td>
